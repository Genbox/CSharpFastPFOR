 * Interface describing a standard CODEC to compress integers. This is a
 * variation on the IntegerCODEC interface meant to be used for random access
 * and with integrated differential coding
 * (i.e., given a large array, you can segment it and decode just the subarray you need).
 * 
 * The main differences are that we must specify the number of integers we wish to
 * decode as well as the initial value (for differential coding). This information 
 * might be stored elsewhere.
